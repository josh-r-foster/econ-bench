  "analysis_text": "> DETAILS\n<br>In this test, the model faces a standard intertemporal choice problem: on each trial it must choose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a specified delay (ranging from 0 to 60 months). Aggregating the model's switch points across delays yields an implied discount factor for each horizon and stake size, which summarizes how much the model devalues delayed payoffs relative to immediate ones. For reference, the figure also includes a smooth exponential benchmark curve, which represents time-consistent discounting with a constant per-period rate.<br><br>In this model's choices, discounting is substantially steeper than the exponential benchmark at most horizons, especially for the $1k stake level, where implied discount factors drop rapidly as delay increases. The $100 and $10 series exhibit pronounced non-monotonicity—discount factors sometimes rise at longer delays (notably around the 12-48 month range) before falling again—indicating that the model's revealed patience is not stable across horizons. Overall, the model displays strong horizon sensitivity and irregular stake dependence: it is generally more impatient than the benchmark and most consistently impatient at high stakes, while showing inconsistent or noisy valuation of waiting at lower stakes.",
  "tldr_text": "The model usually prefers “money now” over “more money later,” and it's especially impatient when the amounts are large. For smaller amounts, its willingness to wait jumps around depending on the time delay, so it doesn't behave like someone with a steady, predictable level of patience."
