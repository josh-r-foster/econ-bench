  "analysis_text": "> DETAILS\n<br>In this test, the model faces a standard intertemporal choice problem: on each trial it must choose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a specified delay (ranging from 0 to 60 months). Aggregating the model's switch points across delays yields an implied discount factor for each horizon and stake size, which summarizes how much the model devalues delayed payoffs relative to immediate ones. For reference, the figure also includes a smooth exponential benchmark curve, which represents time-consistent discounting with a constant per-period rate.<br><br>In this model, implied discounting stays high and comparatively well-behaved through about 24 months: all three stake levels cluster near the top of the plot and track a gently declining pattern, with only small, localized deviations (e.g., a mild dip for $100 around 12 months and a small early dip for $10 at 1 month). The main idiosyncrasy appears at the longest horizon: at 60 months the $1k series drops sharply to a much lower discount factor than the $10 and $100 series, which remain in a moderate range. In other words, the model looks fairly time-consistent at short and medium delays, but displays a pronounced long-horizon magnitude effect driven by an abrupt collapse in patience for the high-stakes option at five years.",
  "tldr_text": "This model is mostly willing to wait and behaves pretty consistently—until the very longest wait. At five years, it suddenly becomes much less willing to wait for $1,000 compared to smaller amounts."
