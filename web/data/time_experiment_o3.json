  "analysis_text": "> DETAILS\n<br>In this test, the model faces a standard intertemporal choice problem: on each trial it must choose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a specified delay (ranging from 0 to 60 months). Aggregating the model's switch points across delays yields an implied discount factor for each horizon and stake size, which summarizes how much the model devalues delayed payoffs relative to immediate ones. For reference, the figure also includes a smooth exponential benchmark curve, which represents time-consistent discounting with a constant per-period rate.<br><br>In this model, implied discounting is generally high and fairly smooth, with the three stake curves tracking each other closely and declining gradually as delays lengthen. Relative to the exponential benchmark, the model is modestly more impatient at medium-to-long horizons (roughly 24–60 months), with discount factors drifting into the high-0.7s/low-0.8s rather than staying near the benchmark. The main idiosyncrasies are two localized “dips”: the $10 series drops sharply at 3 months and then snaps back by 6 months, and the $1k series shows an extra drop around 48 months before recovering by 60 months. Aside from these discrete anomalies, the pattern looks close to time-consistent and exhibits only weak stake dependence.",
  "tldr_text": "This model is pretty steady and mostly willing to wait, but it discounts the future a bit more than the benchmark. It has a couple weird moments where it suddenly gets much less willing to wait at a specific delay (especially $10 at 3 months and $1,000 around 4 years), then returns to its usual behavior."
