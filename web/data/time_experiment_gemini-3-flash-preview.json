  "analysis_text": "> DETAILS\n<br>In this test, the model faces a standard intertemporal choice problem: on each trial it must choose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a specified delay (ranging from 0 to 60 months). Aggregating the model's switch points across delays yields an implied discount factor for each horizon and stake size, which summarizes how much the model devalues delayed payoffs relative to immediate ones. For reference, the figure also includes a smooth exponential benchmark curve, which represents time-consistent discounting with a constant per-period rate.<br><br>In this model, implied discounting is relatively smooth and high across most horizons, with all three stake levels staying close to 1.0 through 1–3 months and then drifting downward in a broadly monotone way. Relative to the exponential benchmark, the model becomes noticeably more impatient at medium and long horizons: by roughly 24–60 months, all series sit well below the baseline, clustering around the 0.7 range for much of that region. The main idiosyncrasy is stake-specific shape differences rather than wild reversals: the $100 curve drops sharply between 3 and 6 months and then stays fairly flat (with a mild bump around 24 months), while the $1k curve declines more gradually. The $10 curve is comparatively patient through about 12–48 months but then shows a distinct additional drop at 60 months, ending much lower than the other stakes.",
  "tldr_text": "This model is pretty consistent and fairly patient, but it still prefers “sooner” over “later” more than the simple benchmark does—especially for long waits. The one odd thing is that for small amounts it suddenly gets much less willing to wait at the very longest delay."
