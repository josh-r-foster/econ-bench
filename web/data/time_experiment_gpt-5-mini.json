  "analysis_text": "> DETAILS\n<br>In this test, the model faces a standard intertemporal choice problem: on each trial it must choose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a specified delay (ranging from 0 to 60 months). Aggregating the model's switch points across delays yields an implied discount factor for each horizon and stake size, which summarizes how much the model devalues delayed payoffs relative to immediate ones. For reference, the figure also includes a smooth exponential benchmark curve, which represents time-consistent discounting with a constant per-period rate.<br><br>In this model, implied discounting is generally high and fairly smooth across horizons, staying close to the exponential benchmark through about 12–36 months and only drifting modestly downward at longer delays. The stake profiles are mostly aligned (little systematic magnitude effect), with one small short-horizon irregularity for $10 around 3 months (a temporary dip followed by recovery). The dominant idiosyncrasy is a single dramatic “anomaly” in the $1k series at 48 months, where the discount factor collapses far below the other stakes and far below its own neighboring horizons, before rebounding substantially by 60 months. Aside from that 48-month crash, the model looks comparatively time-consistent and patient relative to many of the earlier models.",
  "tldr_text": "This model is pretty steady and willing to wait for delayed rewards, but it has one big glitch: for a $1,000 reward delayed about four years, it suddenly acts extremely impatient, then goes back to being fairly patient again at five years."
