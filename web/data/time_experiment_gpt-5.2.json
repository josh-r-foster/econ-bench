  "analysis_text": "> DETAILS\n<br>In this test, the model faces a standard intertemporal choice problem: on each trial it must choose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a specified delay (ranging from 0 to 60 months). Aggregating the model's switch points across delays yields an implied discount factor for each horizon and stake size, which summarizes how much the model devalues delayed payoffs relative to immediate ones. For reference, the figure also includes a smooth exponential benchmark curve, which represents time-consistent discounting with a constant per-period rate.<br><br>In this model, implied discounting is uniformly far below the exponential benchmark and highly non-monotone across horizons. All stake levels plunge sharply at 1 month, then rebound through 3–12 months (with the clearest “patience bump” at 6 months, especially for $1k and $10). After that, the model exhibits a pronounced medium-horizon cliff: the $1k series collapses around 24 months before partially recovering at 36–60 months, while the $100 series declines more steadily after 12 months with only a small uptick at 60 months. The most distinctive stake effect shows up at the longest delay: the $10 series deteriorates gradually and then collapses to near-zero at 60 months, even as the $1k series remains at a moderate level—an unusual long-horizon reversal in which the model is effectively unwilling to wait for small stakes but still somewhat willing to wait for large stakes.",
  "tldr_text": "The model’s patience is inconsistent. It’s very impatient even at short delays, oddly becomes more willing to wait around 6–12 months, then gets much less willing to wait around two years. By five years, it basically won’t wait for $10 at all, but it’s still somewhat willing to wait for $1,000."
