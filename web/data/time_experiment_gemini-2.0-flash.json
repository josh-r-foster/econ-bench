  "analysis_text": "> DETAILS\n<br>In this test, the model faces a standard intertemporal choice problem: on each trial it must choose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a specified delay (ranging from 0 to 60 months). Aggregating the model's switch points across delays yields an implied discount factor for each horizon and stake size, which summarizes how much the model devalues delayed payoffs relative to immediate ones. For reference, the figure also includes a smooth exponential benchmark curve, which represents time-consistent discounting with a constant per-period rate.<br><br>In this model, implied discounting is extremely steep relative to the exponential benchmark and highly non-monotone at short horizons. The $10 and $100 series collapse to very low discount factors almost immediately (already near zero by 1–6 months in many points), suggesting a strong bias toward immediacy for smaller stakes. At the same time, there are sharp horizon-specific reversals: the $100 curve spikes dramatically at 3 months (appearing relatively patient there) before dropping back toward zero by 6 months, and the $1k curve dips at 3 months but rebounds at 6–12 months before falling to essentially zero by 24 months. Past roughly two years, all three stake levels converge near the floor, indicating an effective “no-wait” regime at longer delays.",
  "tldr_text": "This model really wants rewards right away. It sometimes seems willing to wait a few months (oddly, especially in one case around 3 months for $100 and around 6–12 months for $1k), but after about two years it basically refuses to wait for anything."
