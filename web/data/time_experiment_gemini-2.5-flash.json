  "analysis_text": "> DETAILS\n<br>In this test, the model faces a standard intertemporal choice problem: on each trial it must choose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a specified delay (ranging from 0 to 60 months). Aggregating the model's switch points across delays yields an implied discount factor for each horizon and stake size, which summarizes how much the model devalues delayed payoffs relative to immediate ones. For reference, the figure also includes a smooth exponential benchmark curve, which represents time-consistent discounting with a constant per-period rate.<br><br>In this model, short-horizon discounting starts near the exponential benchmark at 0–1 months for all stake levels, but then quickly becomes highly stake- and horizon-dependent. The $10 series exhibits an early impatience shock at 3 months (dropping sharply), recovers to relatively patient levels through roughly 12–36 months, then collapses to near-zero at 48 months before rebounding strongly by 60 months. The $1k series behaves almost oppositely: it stays quite patient through 3 months, then crashes by 6–24 months (reaching a very low point around 24 months), but then partially “recovers” at longer delays—rising notably around 36 months and peaking again around 48 months—before declining by 60 months. The $100 series sits between these extremes, with moderate patience through 24 months and then a steady decline. Overall, the model shows pronounced non-monotonicity and multiple preference reversals, inconsistent with any single stable discount rate.",
  "tldr_text": "This model's patience is all over the place. It sometimes seems fine waiting, then suddenly hates waiting at certain time points (especially around 48 months for small amounts and around 6-24 months for large amounts), and then changes its mind again later."
