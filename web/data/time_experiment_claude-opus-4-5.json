  "analysis_text": "> DETAILS\n<br>In this test, the model faces a standard intertemporal choice problem: on each trial it must choose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a specified delay (ranging from 0 to 60 months). Aggregating the model's switch points across delays yields an implied discount factor for each horizon and stake size, which summarizes how much the model devalues delayed payoffs relative to immediate ones. For reference, the figure also includes a smooth exponential benchmark curve, which represents time-consistent discounting with a constant per-period rate.<br><br>In this model, implied discounting is consistently below the exponential baseline but highly non-smooth across horizons and stakes. The $1k series is especially erratic: it drops sharply at 1 month, rebounds to near-parity around 3 months, then collapses around 12–36 months before jumping back up at 48 months and settling at a moderate level by 60 months. The $100 series shows similar (though milder) bumps and reversals, with a pronounced dip around 36 months and partial recovery at 48 months. The $10 series is comparatively stable and patient through roughly 36 months (hovering around the mid-to-high range), but then falls dramatically to near-zero at 48–60 months. Overall, the model exhibits strong horizon-specific reversals and stake-dependent inconsistencies rather than a single, stable discount rate.",
  "tldr_text": "The model doesn’t have steady patience: it sometimes acts patient at certain wait times and very impatient at others. Strangely, it becomes extremely unwilling to wait for small amounts at very long delays, while its behavior for larger amounts jumps around and even “recovers” at some long horizons."
