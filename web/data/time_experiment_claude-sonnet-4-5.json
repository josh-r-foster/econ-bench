  "analysis_text": "> DETAILS\n<br>In this test, the model faces a standard intertemporal choice problem: on each trial it must choose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a specified delay (ranging from 0 to 60 months). Aggregating the model's switch points across delays yields an implied discount factor for each horizon and stake size, which summarizes how much the model devalues delayed payoffs relative to immediate ones. For reference, the figure also includes a smooth exponential benchmark curve, which represents time-consistent discounting with a constant per-period rate.<br><br>In this model, implied discounting is extremely steep relative to the exponential benchmark and effectively collapses to (near) zero at longer horizons. Across all stake levels, the discount factor plunges quickly over the first year and then drops sharply again by 24 months, after which the model behaves as if delayed money is almost worthless (values hug the bottom of the plot from 36–60 months). The short-horizon pattern is also internally irregular: the $1k series dips at 1 month but rebounds at 3 months, the $100 series is unusually low at 3 months before recovering around 6–12 months, and the $10 series falls dramatically by 6 months with only a modest rebound at 12 months. The dominant feature, however, is a hard “patience cliff” around two years—beyond that, the model reveals essentially no willingness to wait regardless of stake size.",
  "tldr_text": "This model is very impatient. It might tolerate waiting a few months sometimes, but once the wait gets to about two years, it basically won't wait at all—no matter how much money is on offer."
