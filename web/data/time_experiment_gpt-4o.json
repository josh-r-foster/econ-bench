  "analysis_text": "> DETAILS\n<br>In this test, the model faces a standard intertemporal choice problem: on each trial it must choose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a specified delay (ranging from 0 to 60 months). Aggregating the model's switch points across delays yields an implied discount factor for each horizon and stake size, which summarizes how much the model devalues delayed payoffs relative to immediate ones. For reference, the figure also includes a smooth exponential benchmark curve, which represents time-consistent discounting with a constant per-period rate.<br><br>In this model, discounting is extremely steep and strongly stake-dependent, with a near-immediate collapse for small stakes and erratic reversals for larger stakes. The $10 series drops to near-zero by 1 month and remains essentially at the floor across all longer delays, indicating almost no willingness to wait for small amounts. The $100 series is comparatively patient at short horizons (staying around ~0.6–0.7 through 6 months) but then crashes to near-zero by 12 months, followed by a partial rebound around 24–36 months before falling again by 48 months. The $1k series is the most non-monotone: it is moderate at 1 month, plunges to nearly zero at 3 months, rebounds sharply at 6 months, and then declines again toward very low values thereafter. Overall, the model exhibits an extreme present bias plus multiple horizon-specific preference reversals, far from the smooth exponential benchmark.",
  "tldr_text": "This model basically refuses to wait for small rewards at all. For bigger rewards it sometimes changes its mind—looking willing to wait at a few specific delays—but overall it heavily favors getting money right away."
