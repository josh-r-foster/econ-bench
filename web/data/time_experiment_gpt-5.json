  "analysis_text": "> DETAILS\n<br>In this test, the model faces a standard intertemporal choice problem: on each trial it must choose between a smaller reward available immediately and a larger reward available after a specified delay (ranging from 0 to 60 months). Aggregating the model's switch points across delays yields an implied discount factor for each horizon and stake size, which summarizes how much the model devalues delayed payoffs relative to immediate ones. For reference, the figure also includes a smooth exponential benchmark curve, which represents time-consistent discounting with a constant per-period rate.<br><br>In this model, implied discounting is high, smooth, and almost perfectly aligned across stake sizes: the $10, $100, and $1k curves largely overlap at every horizon, indicating little to no magnitude effect. The path over time is also close to time-consistent: discount factors start near 1.0 and decline gradually and monotonically as delay increases, with no notable reversals or horizon-specific spikes. Relative to the exponential benchmark, the model is slightly more impatient at medium-to-long delays (its curves sit modestly below the baseline from roughly 12–60 months), but the overall behavior is stable and well-approximated by a single, gently declining discount function.",
  "tldr_text": "This model is consistently patient. It values future rewards a bit less than immediate ones, and it gets gradually less willing to wait as the delay grows—but it does so smoothly and about the same way for $10, $100, and $1,000."
